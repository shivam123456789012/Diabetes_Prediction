# Diabetes_Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and resources for predicting Diabetes or not using machine learning. The project is based on the Diabetes Prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. I am submitting this as my Internship task at TechnoHacks EduTech.
# Objective
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
# Techniques Used
1. Data Cleaning<br>
2. Data Visualization<br>
3. Machine Learning Modeling
# Algortihms Used
1. Logistic Regression<br>
2. Support Vector Machine<br>
3. KNN<br>
4. Random Forest Classifier<br>
5. Decision Tree Classifier<br>
6. Xgboost
# Packages and Tools Required
1. Pandas<br>
2. Matplotlib<br>
3. Numpy<br>
4. Scikit Learn<br>
5. Jupyter Notebook
# Conclusion
After performing 5 different algorithms on the dataset, Random forest gave the best performance with 82% accuracy. So I decide to consider it for further evaluation.
