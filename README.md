# Diabetes_Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and resources for predicting Diabetes or not using machine learning. The project is based on the Diabetes Prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. I am submitting this as my Internship task at TechnoHacks EduTech.
# Objective
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
# Techniques Used
Data Cleaning, 
Data Visualization,
Machine Learning Modeling,
# Algortihms Used
Logistic Regression,
Support Vector Machine,
KNN,
Random Forest Classifier,
Decision Tree Classifier,
Xgboost,
# Packages and Tools Required
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
Numpy,
Scikit Learn,
Jupyter Notebook,
# Conclusion
After performing 5 different algorithms on the dataset, Random forest gave the best performance with 82% accuracy. So I decide to consider it for further evaluation.
